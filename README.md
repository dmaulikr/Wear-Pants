Getting frustrated when you wear pants on a hot day, and wished you wore shorts? Well, fear no more, because "Should I Wear Pants Today" solves all of A$AP's problems in life. Well not really, but your 99 problems have reduced to 98 problems as witnessed by JAY-Z. 

Going through a complex algorithm similarly to Einstein's theory of relativity, it bases the day's weather on 6 different algorithms, including your race, in order to give the golden boolean. 

Lana Del Ray may not enjoy this application because it tries to reduce your Summertime Sadness, but fails to do so since it's alway sunny. Or you can go to Seattle, aka the modern Gotham (I think I saw Batman once). 

This app has a bit of AI in this, the more you use it the more it becomes accurate. Just click "Nice" or "Bad" and it adjusts it according to your tastes. Though the more you use it the app may know too much and this might become the next Skynet, because pants are so crucial to this world.
