Wear-Pants
==========
This app is being recoded from the bottom up. In the folder repository you can see New Wear Pants and Old Wear Pants. Old Wear Pants contains a single view containing all the code for the project. This folder is no deprecrated and not supported. I recommend NOT looking at this folder, this is just there for history purposes. The new folder you should be looking at is "New Wear Pants". This will have subclassing and categories in order to organize the code. In addition to this there are several speed improvements to the code, in addition to adding world support. The new code will also make use of REST APIs, instead of using HTML scraping, allowing for the response times to be faster than usual.

Getting frustrated when you wear pants on a hot day, and wished you wore shorts? Well, fear no more, because "Should I Wear Pants Today" solves all of A$AP's problems in life. Well not really, but your 99 problems have reduced to 98 problems as witnessed by JAY-Z. 

Going through a complex algorithm similarly to Einstein's theory of relativity, it bases the day's weather on 6 different algorithms, including your race, in order to give the golden boolean. 

Lana Del Ray may not enjoy this application because it tries to reduce your Summertime Sadness, but fails to do so since it's alway sunny. Or you can go to Seattle, aka the modern Gotham (I think I saw Batman once). 

This app has a bit of AI in this, the more you use it the more it becomes accurate. Just click "Nice" or "Bad" and it adjusts it according to your tastes. Though the more you use it the app may know too much and this might become the next Skynet, because pants are so crucial to this world.
